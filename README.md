# LMN-3-Keycaps
This repository contains the OpenSCAD files for the LMN-3 keycaps. It also contains printable icons that can be used for labeling physical keycaps. These keycap models are used in the [LMN-3-MCAD](https://github.com/FundamentalFrequency/LMN-3-MCAD) FreeCAD assembly, and not the
actual device itself. 

If you would like to support the project, please consider becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/stonepreston).

The code relies on the [KeyV2 library](https://github.com/rsheldiii/KeyV2).

## Cloning the Repository
This repository relies on git submodules. You must clone the submodules as well using:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/stonepreston/LMN-3-Keycaps
```

## Thanks
This project would not be possible without the following free and open source projects:
- [KeyV2](https://github.com/rsheldiii/KeyV2)
- [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad)
